Precalculus on Khan Academy: You may think that precalculus is simply the course you take before calculus. You would be right, of course, but that definition doesn't mean anything unless you have some knowledge of what calculus is. Let's keep it simple, shall we? Calculus is a conceptual framework which provides systematic techniques for solving problems. These problems are appropriately applicable to analytic geometry and algebra. Therefore....precalculus gives you the background for the mathematical concepts, problems, issues and techniques that appear in calculus, including trigonometry, functions, complex numbers, vectors, matrices, and others. There you have it ladies and gentlemen....an introduction to precalculus!

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

Linear Algebra on Khan Academy: Have you ever wondered what the difference is between speed and velocity? Ever try to visualize in four dimensions or six or seven? Linear algebra describes things in two dimensions, but many of the concepts can be extended into three, four or more. Linear algebra implies two dimensional reasoning, however, the concepts covered in linear algebra provide the basis for multi-dimensional representations of mathematical reasoning. Matrices, vectors, vector spaces, transformations, eigenvectors/values all help us to visualize and understand multi dimensional concepts. This is an advanced course normally taken by science or engineering majors after taking at least two semesters of calculus (although calculus really isn't a prereq) so don't confuse this with regular high school algebra.

Linear Algebra on Khan Academy: Have you ever wondered what the difference is between speed and velocity? Ever try to visualize in four dimensions or six or seven? Linear algebra describes things in two dimensions, but many of the concepts can be extended into three, four or more. Linear algebra implies two dimensional reasoning, however, the concepts covered in linear algebra provide the basis for multi-dimensional representations of mathematical reasoning. Matrices, vectors, vector spaces, transformations, eigenvectors/values all help us to visualize and understand multi dimensional concepts. This is an advanced course normally taken by science or engineering majors after taking at least two semesters of calculus (although calculus really isn't a prereq) so don't confuse this with regular high school algebra.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps.

It describes our 3 d reality. As an initiate (I hold a masters in engineering, but never actually worked in that capacity, so it's been a while since I've looked at this) \nI have always wondered: To calculate forces in 3d, we use matrix calculation (cfr: Willey & sons: Engineering mechanics - Statics). Now these matrices can have n (infinite) dimensions. Could it be Euclides only described what he could see and the fact that we use matrices (applicable to n dimensions) to calculate vectors (3 dimensions...as far as we know) is actually trying to tell us, there's an infinite number of dimensions and ergo more than 3 vectors that describe our world?\nAnyone?"", ""This is godlike!

I tried a similar example in 2D and the whole (b-a) concept shows the same -- it creates a line parallel to the line that connecting the endpoints b and a creates, but never actually the line"", ""10:56 I changed the order, I use X0 minus X, then I get different equation for the plane. Why's that? does the direction of the vector also matters?"", 'Great explainer. In every complex thought, there is always a key note; if you miss it, you will never get the complex one. Herein the key thought is the fact that the difference between any given two position vectors having their heads as points on the hyperplane lies always on the hyperplane in question, which is always perpendicular to the normal vector to the plane. As you know already, the dot product is always equal to zero when two given vectors are normal to each other. The algebra of the dot product is a treat in linear algebra and something that can be thought of as a a special case of ‚Äúlinear‚Äù transformation. The hyperplane is  the span of the difference of any two position vectors and they all must be perpendicular to the normal vector to that plane. In other words, the normal vector lies in the null-space of the hyperplane. This fact is of particular interest to unique solutions of linear transformations or matrix operations. Finding unique solutions of linear transformation is probably the most fascinating feature of linear algebra and could always be thought of as the coordinates of the difference of two points on the hyperplane.  \n\nIn differential geometry, this incremental difference between two position vector being always perpendicular to the position vector is fascinating when the increment is always tangential to the surface created by the position vector undergoing a change. In two dimensions, this generates polar coordinates; in three dimensions, this generates cylindrical and spherical coordinates with a nice set of orthogonal basis!  \n\nThanks for always being the best explainer!']"

Linear algebra implies two dimensional reasoning, however, the concepts covered in linear algebra provide the basis for multi-dimensional representations of mathematical reasoning. Matrices, vectors, vector spaces, transformations, eigenvectors/values all help us to visualize and understand multi dimensional concepts. This is an advanced course normally taken by science or engineering majors after taking at least two semesters of calculus (although calculus really isn't a prereq) so don't confuse this with regular high school algebra.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more.

Thus, A x = [x1+x2+x3+x4 , 2*x1+x2+4*x3+3*x4 , 3*x1+4*x2+x3+2*x4]. Thus we get b = [x1+x2+x3+x4 , 2*x1+x2+4*x3+3*x4 , 3*x1+4*x2+x3+2*x4]. For compactness, and to translate to our geometric interpretation, let us re-label b as b=[x,y,z].

Linear Algebra on Khan Academy: Have you ever wondered what the difference is between speed and velocity? Ever try to visualize in four dimensions or six or seven? Linear algebra describes things in two dimensions, but many of the concepts can be extended into three, four or more. Linear algebra implies two dimensional reasoning, however, the concepts covered in linear algebra provide the basis for multi-dimensional representations of mathematical reasoning. Matrices, vectors, vector spaces, transformations, eigenvectors/values all help us to visualize and understand multi dimensional concepts. This is an advanced course normally taken by science or engineering majors after taking at least two semesters of calculus (although calculus really isn't a prereq) so don't confuse this with regular high school algebra.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom.

Linear Algebra on Khan Academy: Have you ever wondered what the difference is between speed and velocity? Ever try to visualize in four dimensions or six or seven? Linear algebra describes things in two dimensions, but many of the concepts can be extended into three, four or more. Linear algebra implies two dimensional reasoning, however, the concepts covered in linear algebra provide the basis for multi-dimensional representations of mathematical reasoning. Matrices, vectors, vector spaces, transformations, eigenvectors/values all help us to visualize and understand multi dimensional concepts. This is an advanced course normally taken by science or engineering majors after taking at least two semesters of calculus (although calculus really isn't a prereq) so don't confuse this with regular high school algebra.

Linear Algebra on Khan Academy: Have you ever wondered what the difference is between speed and velocity? Ever try to visualize in four dimensions or six or seven? Linear algebra describes things in two dimensions, but many of the concepts can be extended into three, four or more. Linear algebra implies two dimensional reasoning, however, the concepts covered in linear algebra provide the basis for multi-dimensional representations of mathematical reasoning. Matrices, vectors, vector spaces, transformations, eigenvectors/values all help us to visualize and understand multi dimensional concepts. This is an advanced course normally taken by science or engineering majors after taking at least two semesters of calculus (although calculus really isn't a prereq) so don't confuse this with regular high school algebra.

Can't express how grateful I am for them.  Can't wait to finish these and pursue more and more.  So generous of Sal and the team!  One thing that I hope people find interesting is that there's another way of arriving at the formula for the scalar multiplier of v for the projection of x on L.  I think of it as first determine the length of the projection, then ensure it's directed appropriately.  The length to me is simply x cos(theta) where theta is the angle between x and v.  But we know that x cos(theta) is then just v dot x divided by the length of v, which in the numerical example yields 7/sqrt(5) as the required length of the projection using his example vectors for v and x.  Then to find the right direction of the projection vector, it must be some scalar c times the starting vector of L, v, to yield the projection.  And c times v must have that length v dot x divided by the length of v which we calculated as being 7/sqrt(5) using his example vectors as stated above.  Solving for c gives you v dot x divided by (the length of v times the length of v) which is just (v dot x) divided by (v dot v) which is exactly what Sal arrived at as well with the resulting vector being [14/5, 7/5].  He just got there using the difference of vectors and leveraging the resulting normal vector to the line and this version outlined above doesn't, felt a bit more intuitive to me, just focusing on the projection itself using cosines."", 'How is the pink vector x - projection of x?', 'Can anyone say why on the earth we should project a vector onto another orthogonally, but not like an arch', 'Linear Algebra  Comeback season', ""I got very confused for a while thinking that a vector dot itself is 1. But that's only true with unit vectors, in other cases the dot is the square of the magnitude. \n\nSo, the area of the magnitude, like a square box coming off the vector. Which now has me thinking: what does the determinant look like geometrically? Is it the area between the vectors?"", 'awesome, I went through three other videos and they threw me a magic scalar formula without explaining why :) sal never disappoints', 'I watch explanations of you only.....as you explain what I want exactly,but even one video is there like this....which explains what I want', 'Love the graphs', 'Thank you Soo much.....', 'I wish my professor explained it this way.. 4 wasted lectures lmao, instead of a simple 14 mins explanation']"

Linear Algebra on Khan Academy: Have you ever wondered what the difference is between speed and velocity? Ever try to visualize in four dimensions or six or seven? Linear algebra describes things in two dimensions, but many of the concepts can be extended into three, four or more. Linear algebra implies two dimensional reasoning, however, the concepts covered in linear algebra provide the basis for multi-dimensional representations of mathematical reasoning. Matrices, vectors, vector spaces, transformations, eigenvectors/values all help us to visualize and understand multi dimensional concepts. This is an advanced course normally taken by science or engineering majors after taking at least two semesters of calculus (although calculus really isn't a prereq) so don't confuse this with regular high school algebra.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom.

Linear Algebra on Khan Academy: Have you ever wondered what the difference is between speed and velocity? Ever try to visualize in four dimensions or six or seven? Linear algebra describes things in two dimensions, but many of the concepts can be extended into three, four or more. Linear algebra implies two dimensional reasoning, however, the concepts covered in linear algebra provide the basis for multi-dimensional representations of mathematical reasoning. Matrices, vectors, vector spaces, transformations, eigenvectors/values all help us to visualize and understand multi dimensional concepts. This is an advanced course normally taken by science or engineering majors after taking at least two semesters of calculus (although calculus really isn't a prereq) so don't confuse this with regular high school algebra.

Linear Algebra on Khan Academy: Have you ever wondered what the difference is between speed and velocity? Ever try to visualize in four dimensions or six or seven? Linear algebra describes things in two dimensions, but many of the concepts can be extended into three, four or more. Linear algebra implies two dimensional reasoning, however, the concepts covered in linear algebra provide the basis for multi-dimensional representations of mathematical reasoning. Matrices, vectors, vector spaces, transformations, eigenvectors/values all help us to visualize and understand multi dimensional concepts. This is an advanced course normally taken by science or engineering majors after taking at least two semesters of calculus (although calculus really isn't a prereq) so don't confuse this with regular high school algebra.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom.

ONLY vectors in that column space may make up some possible vector b. We use that to know which vectors b we may write as part of the question. \n\nThe ""solution"" however is vector x. \n\nTry solving THIS \nm1  -1  \nm2  -1  \n\n multiplied by the column vector <x,y> \n\nresults in the column vector <-b1, -b2>\n\nThe equations are \nm1x - y = -b1\nm2x - y = - b2\n\nRearranging\ny = m1x + b1\ny = m2x + b2\n\nNote the 1 and 2 following m and b should be taken as subscripts. \n\nIn the form you are used to....the values b1 and b2 are part of the equation defining the location of the line on the graph. Instead it is x and y which are the unknowns. \n(Note that you can take ANY 2x2 matrix A and multiply each line through by some factor to where the second column consists only of -1s. Yeah ya are allowed to do that. This gets your line equations into the y=mx+b sort of format albeit some things are moved to other sides of the = sign. This can make it much easier to graph both equations by hand. You can then go on with standard methods to solve the equations from the original matrix A or from your current one with the y coefficient as -1. You can also multiply or divide rows in a 2x2 matrix through by a factor to get the b values to be 1. This is useful if you know the intercept intercept form of the line equation.

Linear Algebra on Khan Academy: Have you ever wondered what the difference is between speed and velocity? Ever try to visualize in four dimensions or six or seven? Linear algebra describes things in two dimensions, but many of the concepts can be extended into three, four or more. Linear algebra implies two dimensional reasoning, however, the concepts covered in linear algebra provide the basis for multi-dimensional representations of mathematical reasoning. Matrices, vectors, vector spaces, transformations, eigenvectors/values all help us to visualize and understand multi dimensional concepts. This is an advanced course normally taken by science or engineering majors after taking at least two semesters of calculus (although calculus really isn't a prereq) so don't confuse this with regular high school algebra.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

Yeah ya are allowed to do that. This gets your line equations into the y=mx+b sort of format albeit some things are moved to other sides of the = sign. This can make it much easier to graph both equations by hand. You can then go on with standard methods to solve the equations from the original matrix A or from your current one with the y coefficient as -1. You can also multiply or divide rows in a 2x2 matrix through by a factor to get the b values to be 1. This is useful if you know the intercept intercept form of the line equation. Another form of the line equation that is useful is the normal form. You can take the square of the x coefficient and add this to the square of the y coefficient. Take the square root of that. Divide your row by that. Do that to each row and you have normalized line equations. This form allows you to read off things about direction cosines and distance from the origin of the line. In other words....dont forget all the things you know about lines from algebra and analytic geometry. If you never took analytic geometry, pick up a copy of a text book to use as a reference. Even an older text book from the 50s or so....will still work as a reference. )\n\n""The solution"" means...at what point ie some (x,y) DO these lines cross to where there is ""a solution"". Note that this solution is written as the vector (matrix) from the origin to that point. \n\nNow if you understand that each row represents an equation....and you are looking for ""the point"" where the lines cross, you should understand that \n\nif the lines NEVER cross ie are parallel, there is no solution. \n\nExample\n\n2x -y  -4\n2x -y  -3 \n\nEquivalent to \ny=2x+4  and y=2x+3\n\nSubtract the second equation from the first and you get \n\n0 0 -1 in the row ie zero of x and zero of y yields -1 which is impossible. \nIf lines are parallel and you fail to notice this....you will get nonsense when you try to come up with a solution Look again and realize what went wrong ie the lines were parallel. \n\nA great possibility is when the lines cross at one point. That point....is ""the solution"". Again, you write that as the vector pointing from the origin to that point. This is written as  a column vector <x,y> and shows up in your equation Ax=b as x. \n\nThere is yet another possibility when you hunt for ""the solution"" ie the point where the lines cross is where line in equations given are actually multiples of the same line or are identical equations. Then the two lines coincide at EVERY point, so there are infinitely many solutions. Where may some point (x, y) be found on one line and also on the other line? At every point on both lines. \n\nPart of the confusion is because the solution matrix x.....tells what linear combination of the columns of A which would lead to column vector b. Realize again that this only tells you what vectors b are possible. Of those, a vector b is chosen and THEN ....the solution asked for is still the column vector x in the equation \nAx = b. \n\nNotice that the row vectors of A in the non augmented matrix have a certain number of elements. ""The solution"" matrix x MUST have this same number of elements. The vectors in the null space (not the null space of A transpose....but the null space of A)....have the same number of elements as the row vectors of the non augmented matrix, and of the solution vector X. \n\nThe number of elements in the row of A (non augmented) and the solution matrix x must be the same or it would be impossible to get the product Ax.  This is true no matter if the matrix b is the zero matrix or some other matrix. \n\nText books make a HUGE deal about the number of elements in the row matrices of non augmented matrix A. If it is 2 elements, then the books say the row space is in R2. Usually the 2 is written as a superscript. \n\nNotice that the number of elements in the columns in A is the same as the number of elements in the matrix b.  If you transposed matrix A and used this as before....the number of elements in the columns of A would become the number of elements in the rows, and of solution matrices of A transpose. \n\nIf....you see a matrix A that has a different number of elements in its rows vs its columns and you believe any of the following, please ask your teacher. \nMyth ...""the solution is matrix b"" No!\nMyth....""the solution should have the same numer of elements as the columns of A do. No\n\nIf you can not look at a 2x2 matrix and draw the equations on the graph....and point on the graph to what the question asks for when it asks for ""the solution"" then please DO ask your teacher to clarify this again. \n\nIf you can NOT explain why the solution MUST have the same number of elements as the rows of the non augmented matrix A, please ask your teacher. \n\nYou should be able to explain what will happen if the lines are parallel, cross at one point, or coincide when you try to ""solve the equations"". \n\nYou should be able to explain what is meant by vectors in the column space of A, what matrix x does to these....and how that causes matrix b. Make sure you can draw examples from 2x2 matrices of column vectors that then combine to form some matrix b. If not....please DO ask your teacher to explain this again. \n\nKnow what is meant by vector b must be in the column space of A. \n\nPlease DO be able to explain....why when we are looking for a point....how come ""the solution"" is actually a matrix with a single column only ie a vector. Be able to show on a graph exactly what that vector is telling you. \n\nKnow that ""the solution"" is another way of saying....is there some (x,y) that will work for the first line equation....that ALSO works for the second line equation? Know this happens where the graph of the lines cross. Know how to express a vector pointing from the origin to exactly this point. \n\nI saw in looking over several Khan Academy videos....comments that showed marked confusion on these issues.', 'You didnt turn  the row space vector into a unit vector. The denominator 13 is only there in your answer C because that was not done. Notice 13 is exactly the magnitude of that vector. \n\nThe 3, -2 vector is an arbitrary basis vector. You could have chosen any multiple of that as the basis vector. \nOnce you have the unit vector in the row space, your vector is 9 times that.', '14:34  r is a member of RowSpace not column space; Should have said RowSpace instead of Column Space.', ""I've been picturing a line and plane in R3 in my head to get me through the last 3 or 4 videos.  Thanks for finally getting to this and confirming my intuition :)"", ""There are a couple of things I'm not clear about. \r\n\r\nHow can the 'shortest' solution to Ax=b be nonzero and lie in the rowspace of A if the solution set of that equation is orthogonal to that rowspace (see 12.42)?\r\n\r\nSecond,it seems to me that the notion of vector addition has been changed: [0  3] + c[2  3] is no longer the diagonal of the corresponding parallelogram but c[2  3] displaced by [0  3]. I'm confused about a line representing the vectors in it or the vectors that point to it. "", 'Good. Thank you.', 'Thank you Sal :)']"

Linear Algebra on Khan Academy: Have you ever wondered what the difference is between speed and velocity? Ever try to visualize in four dimensions or six or seven? Linear algebra describes things in two dimensions, but many of the concepts can be extended into three, four or more. Linear algebra implies two dimensional reasoning, however, the concepts covered in linear algebra provide the basis for multi-dimensional representations of mathematical reasoning. Matrices, vectors, vector spaces, transformations, eigenvectors/values all help us to visualize and understand multi dimensional concepts. This is an advanced course normally taken by science or engineering majors after taking at least two semesters of calculus (although calculus really isn't a prereq) so don't confuse this with regular high school algebra.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom.

Linear Algebra on Khan Academy: Have you ever wondered what the difference is between speed and velocity? Ever try to visualize in four dimensions or six or seven? Linear algebra describes things in two dimensions, but many of the concepts can be extended into three, four or more. Linear algebra implies two dimensional reasoning, however, the concepts covered in linear algebra provide the basis for multi-dimensional representations of mathematical reasoning. Matrices, vectors, vector spaces, transformations, eigenvectors/values all help us to visualize and understand multi dimensional concepts. This is an advanced course normally taken by science or engineering majors after taking at least two semesters of calculus (although calculus really isn't a prereq) so don't confuse this with regular high school algebra.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

Linear Algebra on Khan Academy: Have you ever wondered what the difference is between speed and velocity? Ever try to visualize in four dimensions or six or seven? Linear algebra describes things in two dimensions, but many of the concepts can be extended into three, four or more. Linear algebra implies two dimensional reasoning, however, the concepts covered in linear algebra provide the basis for multi-dimensional representations of mathematical reasoning. Matrices, vectors, vector spaces, transformations, eigenvectors/values all help us to visualize and understand multi dimensional concepts. This is an advanced course normally taken by science or engineering majors after taking at least two semesters of calculus (although calculus really isn't a prereq) so don't confuse this with regular high school algebra.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more.

Linear Algebra on Khan Academy: Have you ever wondered what the difference is between speed and velocity? Ever try to visualize in four dimensions or six or seven? Linear algebra describes things in two dimensions, but many of the concepts can be extended into three, four or more. Linear algebra implies two dimensional reasoning, however, the concepts covered in linear algebra provide the basis for multi-dimensional representations of mathematical reasoning. Matrices, vectors, vector spaces, transformations, eigenvectors/values all help us to visualize and understand multi dimensional concepts. This is an advanced course normally taken by science or engineering majors after taking at least two semesters of calculus (although calculus really isn't a prereq) so don't confuse this with regular high school algebra.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.

Precalculus on Khan Academy: You may think that precalculus is simply the course you take before calculus. You would be right, of course, but that definition doesn't mean anything unless you have some knowledge of what calculus is. Let's keep it simple, shall we? Calculus is a conceptual framework which provides systematic techniques for solving problems. These problems are appropriately applicable to analytic geometry and algebra. Therefore....precalculus gives you the background for the mathematical concepts, problems, issues and techniques that appear in calculus, including trigonometry, functions, complex numbers, vectors, matrices, and others. There you have it ladies and gentlemen....an introduction to precalculus!

It works for ODEs perfectly well, but the PDEs are a challenge because the limit expressions become hairy very quickly.\n\nI thought I understood limits but my work quickly pushed me to the realization that I don\'t know half as much as I thought I did. Trust me, limits are important. Not just for understanding how calculus works, but for computational mathematics. I think my approach might one day allow me to ""hack"" numerical methods. For example, a rref() operation, say, on a matrix could take n^3/3 operations. I think a limit expression could massively cut down on the computational cost, all while producing more stable numerical estimations. Learn your limits kids. Thanks Sal, finding all these videos on limits (from your playlist) is really saving me some time.\n\nYours gratefully,\nA dropout :)\n\nEdit: Once I understand what it is I\'m even trying to do, I\'ll figure out how to write a pattern-generation algorithm that generates the limit expressions automagically.

I worked this out myself some time ago using the traditional back of an envelope of scrap paper. Only difference - I integrated from zero to +1, not -1 to +1 to avoid too much messing around with minus signs. This gave the volume of a hemisphere, i.e. 2/3*pi*r^3. Then double this to arrive at the same answer 4/3*pi*r^3.\n\n\nWhat happens if you extend this method to more than 3 dimensions? This and the last video suggest line integral -> disk integral... -> sphere integral in 4-D? But in 4-D, what is the axis of rotation? If we refer to 'axis' (which has psychologically indelible 1-D associations, i.e. a line) as a 'spindle'... let's see, does this work? Any comments? If we're in a 2-D world, the spindle is a zero-D point. If you're in 2-D you can rotate either a line (1-D) or another 2-D shape (circle, Edwin Abbot's Flatland's 'Mr Square' etc) around a point, which is 2 dimensions down (zero dimensions) from Flatland. If you're in Flatland it makes no sense to rotate around a line (1 dimension down). This suggests that the dimensionality of a spindle will be two dimensions down from the space it's embedded in (or D<spindle> = D<space> - 2). You need to add 1 dimension to the spindle to accommodate the object you‚Äôre rotating and another dimension to rotate into.\n\n\nAny ideas out there?

You explain everything so well it's impossible to not understand!!"", 'Good', 'what the fuk is it?', ""Thanks for the video. Once again, we see this clever, mathematical manipulation of the equation of a vector field called 'taking the divergence' of the field. And, once again, I sit here as mystified as I have always been with this topic! There is one simple question that no-one, repeat NO-ONE ever answers. The question is this. What does the 'divergence' of a vector field tell you about the field that you didn't know before???? The same question applies to the 'curl' of a field. What is the physical interpretation of 'divergence'? Now, I thought that I had worked out an answer many years ago. I thought that the divergence tells you where the sources and sinks of the field, if they exist, can be located. Since we are taking a dot product, the result will be a scalar quantity that is either positive, negative or zero at any (x,y,z) location within the field. If the result is positive, I thought that this signified that, at that location, there is a source of the field; if negative, then at that location, there is a sink for the field. Now, if this is true, I have NEVER seen this EXPLICITLY stated be ANYONE on Youtube. So is it right? Many thanks"", 'why the the first component of the gradient must be the partial derivative with respect to x and not z for example ?', 'If a is constant vector and r is equal to xI+yJ+zK then \ngrad(a,r) is equal to - (0,a,r or 2a???? )', 'your good Sal......just get it more legibal', '240p we meet again']"

Now generalize and combine these two mathematical concepts, and you begin to see some of what Multivariable calculus entails, only now include multi dimensional thinking. Typical concepts or operations may include: limits and continuity, partial differentiation, multiple integration, scalar functions, and fundamental theorem of calculus in multiple dimensions.

About Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.
